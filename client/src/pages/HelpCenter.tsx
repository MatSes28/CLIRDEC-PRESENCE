        {
          q: "What is an RFID card and why do I need it?",
          a: "An RFID card is a contactless smart card that students tap on the reader to mark their attendance automatically. Each student needs a unique RFID card registered in the system. This eliminates manual attendance taking and ensures accurate time tracking."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I start taking attendance for my class?",
          a: "Go to 'Live Attendance', select your subject and section, then click 'Start Session'. Students can now tap their RFID cards to mark their attendance. The system will automatically record who is present, late, or absent."

          q: "How do I contact a student's parent or guardian?",

        {
          q: "How do I manually mark a student present if they forgot their RFID card?",
          a: "During an active class session on the 'Live Attendance' page, you can click the student's name and manually mark them as present. Always add a note explaining why (e.g., 'Forgot RFID card')."
        },
        {

        {
          q: "What should I do if the RFID reader isn't working?",
          a: "Check the 'System Health' page to see if your device is connected. Common issues: 1) Device not powered on, 2) Wrong WiFi credentials, 3) RFID reader not properly connected. Try restarting the device first."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I have multiple RFID readers in one classroom?",
          a: "Yes! You can register multiple ESP32 devices for the same classroom. This is useful for large classes where students need multiple entry points. Each tap is recorded only once per session."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I register RFID cards during student enrollment?",
