**Solution**: Remove it manually via shell

---

## Quick Fix (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Replit Shell (Recommended)
1. Click **Shell** tab in Replit (bottom of screen)
2. Run this command:
   ```bash
   rm -f .git/index.lock
   ```
3. Verify it's gone:
   ```bash
   ls .git/index.lock
   ```
   Should say: `No such file or directory` âœ…

### Method 2: VS Code Terminal
1. Open VS Code Terminal (**Ctrl+`** or **Cmd+`**)
2. Run:
   ```bash
   rm -f .git/index.lock
   ```
3. Try git again:

## After Removing Lock File

### Test Git Works:
```bash
git status
```

### Commit Your Fixes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve all git conflicts"
git push origin main
```

---

## Why This Happened

Git creates `.git/index.lock` during operations to prevent conflicts. If Git crashes or is interrupted, this file can be left behind and blocks all Git operations.

**Solution**: Safe to delete - Git will recreate it when needed.

---

## What to Do Next

1. **Remove lock file** (using method above)
2. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix git conflicts and prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Deploy to Railway** - Follow [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

**Once the lock file is removed, your Git will work normally! ðŸš€**
