Send Notifications: Trigger or review automated messages sent to parents or guardians.

Assign Computers to Students: Allocate workstation assignments for lab-based classes.

Tap RFID to Log Entry/Exit: System handles this automatically via ESP32 + RFID + Sensor logs (students only).

üë©‚Äçüè´ Faculty:

‚öôÔ∏è System Logic Prompt (Admin & Faculty Authentication and Access Control)

Here's a system prompt you can use for developing the logic (backend API or middleware rules):

"Implement a secure role-based access control system for CLIRDEC: PRESENCE. Ensure that:

Only authenticated users (with valid credentials) can access the system.

If role == 'admin', grant full access to all system modules including user/classroom management, dashboard view, discrepancy logs, schedule upload, and lab assignment tools.

If role == 'faculty', restrict access to only class schedule upload, dashboard view, report generation, and lab assignment tools.

Deny access to any endpoint from unauthorized roles (e.g., student users).

Display user-specific dashboard upon login (admin or faculty).

Use JWT or session tokens for persistent login and secure navigation."
