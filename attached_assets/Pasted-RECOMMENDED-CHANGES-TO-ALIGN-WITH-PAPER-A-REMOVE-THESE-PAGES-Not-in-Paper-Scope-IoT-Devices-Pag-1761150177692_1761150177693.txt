RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO ALIGN WITH PAPER
A. REMOVE THESE PAGES (Not in Paper Scope)
IoT Devices Page (/iot) - Remove entirely
System Health Page (/health) - Remove entirely
System Testing Page (/testing) - Remove entirely
Discrepancy Dashboard Page (/discrepancies) - Remove entirely
Compliance Page (/compliance) - Remove entirely
Help Center Page (/help) - Remove entirely
Attendance Monitoring Page (/monitoring) - Remove entirely
Keep only these pages:

Dashboard
Live Attendance (for real-time tracking)
Schedule
Students
Class Roster
Lab Computers
Reports
User Management (Admin only)
Settings
B. SIMPLIFY USER ROLE CAPABILITIES
Faculty should ONLY:

✅ View attendance logs
✅ View reports for their classes
✅ View their schedules
❌ Remove: Create/edit schedules (Admin only in paper)
❌ Remove: Create/manage students (Admin only in paper)
❌ Remove: Send notifications manually (should be automatic only)
❌ Remove: Start/end sessions manually (should be automatic based on schedule)
Admin should ONLY:

✅ Manage users (faculty accounts)
✅ Configure system settings
✅ Manage schedules
✅ Manage students
✅ Manage classrooms
✅ View all reports
❌ Remove: Advanced compliance features (not in paper)
❌ Remove: IoT device management UI (should be background only)
C. COMPUTER TRACKING - ADD ACTUAL USAGE MONITORING
Current: Only tracks computer assignment (which student assigned to which computer)

Paper requires: Track computer usage in real-time

Add:

Login time when student starts using computer
Logout time when student stops
Session duration calculation
Active/inactive status indicator
Display in Lab Computers page showing who's currently using which computer
D. EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS - FOCUS ON PARENTS
Current: Generic notification system

Paper requires: Specifically send to parents/guardians for absences

Change:

Make parent email mandatory in student records
Auto-send absence alerts to parent email (not student email)
Notification should say: "Your child [Student Name] was marked absent from [Subject] on [Date]"
Remove manual notification sending from faculty
E. SIMPLIFY SESSION MANAGEMENT
Current: Faculty can manually start/end sessions

Paper says: "Automatic schedule-based session activation"

Change:

Remove manual "Start Session" button from faculty interface
Sessions should auto-activate based on schedule (schedule says 8:00 AM, session starts at 8:00 AM automatically)
Faculty should only be able to VIEW sessions, not control them
Keep tap-in/tap-out automated based on schedule times
F. ADD DEPLOYMENT SCOPE RESTRICTIONS
Add to system:

Limit to 4 classrooms only (2 lecture, 2 lab rooms)
Add "CLIRDEC Building" identifier to classroom records
Filter dashboard to show only CLIRDEC classrooms
Add restriction: "System deployed only for BSIT students from DIT under College of Engineering"
G. REMOVE ADVANCED FEATURES NOT IN PAPER
Remove these features:

Audit Logs - Not mentioned in paper
GDPR Compliance features - Not mentioned in paper
Rate limiting login attempts - Not mentioned in paper
Password reset tokens - Not mentioned in paper
Consent logs - Not mentioned in paper
Data retention policies - Not mentioned in paper
WebSocket real-time updates - Paper doesn't specify this technology
Role-based complex filtering - Keep it simple: Admin sees all, Faculty sees theirs
H. SIMPLIFY SIDEBAR NAVIGATION
Remove from sidebar:

Monitor
IoT Devices
System Health
System Testing
Discrepancy Dashboard
Compliance
Help Center
Keep only:

Dashboard
Live Attendance
Schedule (read-only for faculty, editable for admin)
Students (read-only for faculty, editable for admin)
Class Roster
Lab Computers
Reports
User Management (Admin only)
Settings
I. ADJUST COMPUTER PAGE FUNCTIONALITY
Current: Basic assignment tracking

Paper needs: Real-time laboratory computer usage monitoring

Add to Computers page:

Show which computer is currently in use (green = occupied, gray = available)
Show student currently logged in to each computer
Show how long they've been using it
Only show computers in laboratory classrooms (not lecture rooms)
J. SIMPLIFY REPORTS PAGE
Current: Complex reporting with many filters

Paper says: "Automated downloadable attendance reports with timestamps and entry/exit status"

Keep only:

Date range selector
Subject filter
Download CSV button
Simple table showing: Student Name, Student ID, Check-in Time, Check-out Time, Status (Present/Late/Absent)
Remove:

Complex charts and graphs
Trend analysis
Multiple export formats
Advanced analytics
K. ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT
Paper doesn't mention: Student enrollment system

Current system has: Complex enrollment tables

Suggestion: Keep it simple - students belong to subjects directly, no separate enrollment tracking needed (or make it admin-only background feature, not a separate page)

L. SETTINGS PAGE - SIMPLIFY
Admin should configure:

Late threshold (default: 15 minutes as per paper)
Absent threshold (default: 60% of class time as per paper)
Email notification settings
System-wide semester/academic year
Faculty should configure:

Personal profile only
Password change only
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
REMOVE: 7 extra pages, advanced compliance features, manual session controls, complex analytics

SIMPLIFY: User permissions, navigation, reports, settings

ADD: Computer usage tracking, parent-focused email notifications, CLIRDEC deployment restrictions

KEEP: Core attendance monitoring with RFID + proximity validation, dashboard, basic reporting, role-based access

This will make your system perfectly aligned with your paper's scope without over-engineering features that aren't documented in your research.
