# CLIRDEC: PRESENCE - Attendance Monitoring System

## Overview

CLIRDEC: PRESENCE is a comprehensive attendance monitoring system designed for Central Luzon State University's Information Technology department. The system combines RFID technology with web-based management tools to provide real-time attendance tracking, automated notifications, and comprehensive reporting for faculty and administrators.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite for build tooling
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with Replit Auth integration

### Backend Architecture (Updated January 26, 2025)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling and error recovery
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with Replit Auth integration
- **WebSocket**: Real-time notifications via WebSocket server on port 5000
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive global error handlers for unhandled rejections

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and connection pooling
- **Session Storage**: In-memory session management for development
- **Performance**: Optimized with error handling and connection recovery
- **Reliability**: Global error handlers prevent unhandled promise rejections

### Known Development Issues
- **Vite HMR WebSocket**: Development environment shows `wss://localhost:undefined` errors from Vite's Hot Module Replacement. This is a Vite configuration issue that doesn't affect application functionality. Error suppression has been added to client-side code.
