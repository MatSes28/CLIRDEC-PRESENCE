# SendGrid Email Setup Instructions

## Problem
The contact parent feature says "email sent successfully" but emails aren't being delivered because SendGrid requires sender verification.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Your Sender Email in SendGrid
1. Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Sender Authentication**
3. Click **Verify a Single Sender**
4. Add your real email address (e.g., your Gmail or university email)
5. Check your email for verification link and click it

### 2. Update Environment Variable
In Replit Secrets, add or update:
- Key: `FROM_EMAIL`
- Value: Your verified email address (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`)

### 3. Test the Email Functionality
After setting up, try the contact feature again. Emails should now be delivered to the parent email addresses.

## Alternative: Use Your Personal Email
If you want to use your personal Gmail/Yahoo/etc email as the sender:
1. Verify that email in SendGrid
2. Set `FROM_EMAIL=yourname@gmail.com` in Replit Secrets
3. Emails will appear to come from your personal email

## Current Status
- ✅ SendGrid API key is configured
- ✅ Email sending code is working
- ❌ Sender email needs verification
- ❌ FROM_EMAIL environment variable needs to be set

Once you complete steps 1-2 above, the parent contact emails will be delivered successfully.
