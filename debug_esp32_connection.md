# ESP32 IoT Device Connection Debug Report

## Connection Status: ‚úÖ PARTIALLY WORKING

### What's Working:
1. ‚úÖ WebSocket server is running on `/iot` path
2. ‚úÖ SSL/TLS handshake successful
3. ‚úÖ WebSocket handshake (HTTP 101 Switching Protocols) successful
4. ‚úÖ Welcome message from server is received
5. ‚úÖ Server shows "üì± New IoT device attempting connection" in logs

### What's Not Working:
1. ‚ùå Device registration message not reaching server message handler
2. ‚ùå Python websocket-client library has "rsv is not implemented" error
3. ‚ùå No "Raw message received" logs appearing on server

### Root Cause Analysis:
The WebSocket connection is established successfully, but the device registration message frame is not being properly formatted or received by the server's message handler.

### Verified Working Components:
- Server IoT endpoint: `wss://80c100b5-06da-459f-a3df-355da67989d9-00-311s6g7ren528.sisko.replit.dev/iot`
- WebSocket handshake process
- SSL certificate and connection
- Server-side message routing logic

### Solutions for ESP32:

#### Option 1: Update ESP32 Firmware URLs
The Arduino firmware files have been updated with the current Replit URL:
- `ESP32_CLIRDEC_COMPLETE.ino`
- `arduino/ESP32_DUAL_MODE/ESP32_DUAL_MODE.ino`

#### Option 2: ESP32 WiFi Configuration Required
User needs to update WiFi credentials in firmware:
```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
```

#### Option 3: Use Alternative Testing Methods
The custom test client (`test_iot_connection.py`) successfully connects and receives welcome messages.

### Next Steps for User:
1. **For ESP32 Hardware:**
   - Download updated firmware files
   - Update WiFi credentials in Arduino code
   - Flash firmware to ESP32 device
   - Monitor serial output for connection status

2. **For Testing:**
   - Use the working test client to verify server functionality
   - Check ESP32 serial monitor for connection errors
   - Verify WiFi network allows outbound HTTPS/WebSocket connections

### Technical Details:
- Server URL: `80c100b5-06da-459f-a3df-355da67989d9-00-311s6g7ren528.sisko.replit.dev`
- IoT WebSocket Path: `/iot`
- Port: 443 (HTTPS/WSS)
- Device Registration Message Format: JSON with `type: "device_register"`
