# Project Rules

- Do NOT change or restructure the core architecture (folders, imports, or app structure).
- Only add new pages, components, or routes when explicitly asked.
- Follow existing naming and folder conventions.
- Never modify main app initialization files like app.js, server.js, or main.py unless specified.
- When editing existing files, only insert code in commented sections or add new functions.
- Keep all logic consistent with the current architecture (MVC / modular system).
