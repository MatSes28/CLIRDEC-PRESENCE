## üîí Implemented Security Features

### 1. Audit Logging System (ISO 27001 ¬ß A.12.4.1)
**Purpose**: Track all security-relevant events for forensic analysis and compliance

**Implementation**:
- Comprehensive logging of all user actions (LOGIN, LOGOUT, CREATE, DELETE, HARD_DELETE)
- Captures: User ID, IP address, User Agent, Timestamp, Action status
- Dedicated `audit_logs` database table
- Accessible via Admin Compliance Dashboard

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/audit-logs`

**Compliance Benefit**: Provides evidence of who did what, when, and from where

---

### 2. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection (ISO 27001 ¬ß A.9.4.3)
**Purpose**: Prevent unauthorized access through automated password attacks

**Implementation**:
- **Maximum 5 failed login attempts** per 15-minute window
- Automatic account lockout after threshold exceeded
- IP address monitoring via `login_attempts` table
- Real-time threat detection

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Rate limit check before authentication
const isRateLimited = await auditService.checkRateLimit(email, ipAddress);
if (isRateLimited) {
  return res.status(429).json({ 
    message: "Too many failed login attempts. Please try again later." 
  });
}
```

**Compliance Benefit**: Demonstrates proactive security against common attack vectors

---

### 3. Strong Password Policy (ISO 27001 ¬ß A.9.4.3)
**Purpose**: Ensure password strength meets security best practices

**Implementation**:
- Minimum 8 characters required
- Must include:
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Enforced via Zod validation schema on all password inputs

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
export const strongPasswordSchema = z.string()
  .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters")
  .regex(/[A-Z]/, "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter")
  .regex(/[a-z]/, "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter")
  .regex(/[0-9]/, "Password must contain at least one number")
  .regex(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/, "Password must contain at least one special character");
```

**Compliance Benefit**: Reduces risk of password-based attacks

---

### 4. GDPR Hard Delete - Right to be Forgotten (GDPR Article 17)
**Purpose**: Allow permanent data deletion upon request (GDPR compliance)

**Implementation**:
- **Soft Delete** (default): Marks records as inactive
- **Hard Delete** (on request): Permanently removes data from database
- Requires explicit confirmation token: `'PERMANENTLY_DELETE'`
- All deletions logged in audit trail

**API Endpoints**:
- `DELETE /api/users/:id/permanent` - Permanent user deletion
- `DELETE /api/students/:id/permanent` - Permanent student deletion

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Hard delete requires explicit confirmation
if (confirmation !== 'PERMANENTLY_DELETE') {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    message: "Confirmation required" 
  });
}
```

**Compliance Benefit**: Fulfills GDPR "Right to be Forgotten" requirement

---

### 5. Privacy Consent Management (ISO 27701 ¬ß 7.2.1)
**Purpose**: Track and manage user consent for data processing

**Implementation**:
- **`consent_logs` table** tracks all consent activities
- Records:
  - Privacy policy acceptance
  - Email notification consent
  - Data processing agreements
  - Consent version tracking
  - IP address and User Agent for audit trail

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/consent` - Log consent
- `GET /api/consent/:email` - View all consents
- `GET /api/consent/:email/:type` - Check specific consent

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Example: Log parent consent for email notifications
{
  userType: "parent",
  userEmail: "parent@example.com",
  studentId: 123,
  consentType: "email_notifications",
  consentGiven: true,
  consentVersion: "1.0",
  ipAddress: "192.168.1.1",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0..."
}
```

**Compliance Benefit**: Demonstrates lawful basis for data processing

---

### 6. Data Retention Policies (ISO 27701 ¬ß 7.4.7)
**Purpose**: Automated data lifecycle management and compliance with retention requirements

**Implementation**:
- **`data_retention_policies` table** with configurable retention periods
- Automated cleanup functionality
- Default policies:

| Data Type | Retention Period | Auto-Delete | Legal Basis |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Attendance Records | 5 years | ‚ùå Manual | Philippine Academic Records Law |
| Audit Logs | 2 years | ‚úÖ Enabled | ISO 27001 Requirement |
| Email Notifications | 1 year | ‚úÖ Enabled | Operational Efficiency |
| Login Attempts | 6 months | ‚úÖ Enabled | Security Monitoring |

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/retention-policies` - View policies
- `POST /api/retention-policies` - Create policy
- `PUT /api/retention-policies/:id` - Update policy
- `POST /api/retention-policies/cleanup` - Manual cleanup trigger

**Compliance Benefit**: Data minimization principle - only keep what's necessary

---

### 7. GDPR Data Export - Data Portability (GDPR Article 20)
**Purpose**: Allow individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data

**Implementation**:
- Full JSON export of all personal data
- Includes: Student info, Attendance records, Enrollments, Consent history
- Downloadable format for easy portability

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/export/student/:id` - Export student data (Admin/Faculty)
- `GET /api/export/parent/:email` - Export parent data (includes all children)

**Export Format**:
```json
{
  "exportDate": "2025-10-16T14:30:00Z",
  "student": { /* student details */ },
  "attendance": [ /* all attendance records */ ],
  "enrollments": [ /* enrollment history */ ],
  "consents": [ /* consent logs */ ]
}
```

**Compliance Benefit**: GDPR Article 20 "Right to Data Portability"

---

### 8. Privacy-First Design
**Purpose**: Protect faculty and student privacy by design

**Implementation**:
- **Admins CANNOT edit user accounts** (only CREATE and DELETE)
- Protects faculty passwords and personal information
- Principle of least privilege
- Dedicated `deletion_requests` table for tracking data removal

**Compliance Benefit**: Privacy by Design principle (ISO 27701)
