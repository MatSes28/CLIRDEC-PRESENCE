## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (VS Code)

#### Option A: Using VS Code GUI
1. Open VS Code
2. Click on **Source Control** icon (Ctrl+Shift+G)
3. Click **"Initialize Repository"** (if not already initialized)
4. Stage all changes (click + next to "Changes")
5. Enter commit message: `Initial deployment setup`
6. Click **"Commit"**
7. Click **"Publish Branch"** and select GitHub
8. Choose repository visibility (Public/Private)

#### Option B: Using VS Code Terminal
```bash
# Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment setup"
git branch -M main

# Create GitHub repository and get the URL, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clirdec-presence.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Setup Railway Project

1. **Go to Railway**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign in with GitHub

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click **"New Project"**
   - Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
   - Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
   - Choose `clirdec-presence` repository

3. **Railway Auto-Detection**
   - Railway will detect Node.js application
   - It will use the `railway.json` configuration
   - Build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Start command: `node dist/index.js`

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. **In Railway Dashboard**
   - Click **"New"** ‚Üí **"Database"** ‚Üí **"PostgreSQL"**
   - Railway provisions database instantly

2. **Auto-Configured Variables**
   Railway automatically sets:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (full connection string)
   - `PGHOST`
   - `PGPORT`
   - `PGUSER`
   - `PGPASSWORD`
   - `PGDATABASE`

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Click on Your Service** ‚Üí **"Variables"** tab

2. **Add Required Variables:**

```bash
# Email Service (Required)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=matt.feria@clsu2.edu.ph

# Application (Required)
NODE_ENV=production

# Session Security (Required)
SESSION_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
```

3. **Generate Session Secret:**
```bash
# Run in VS Code terminal:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### Step 5: Deploy Application

Railway will automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Clone from GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
3. ‚úÖ Build application (`npm run build`)
4. ‚úÖ Push database schema (`npm run db:push` - if configured)
5. ‚úÖ Start server (`node dist/index.js`)

**Your app will be live at:** `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

2. **Add GitHub Secrets (VS Code/Browser)**
   - Go to GitHub repository ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - Add these secrets:
     - `RAILWAY_TOKEN` = your Railway token
     - `RAILWAY_SERVICE` = your Railway service name

3. **GitHub Actions Will:**
   - ‚úÖ Run type checks on every PR
   - ‚úÖ Build and test on every push
   - ‚úÖ Auto-deploy to Railway on push to `main`

### Workflow Files Included:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI checks for PRs
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Auto-deploy to Railway

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   
   # Make changes, test locally
   npm run dev
   
   # Commit changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description"
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use VS Code GitHub extension OR
   - Go to GitHub repository in browser
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - CI will run automatically

3. **Merge to Main**
   - Review and approve PR
   - Merge to `main` branch
   - Railway auto-deploys latest code

### Hotfix Workflow

```bash
# For urgent fixes
git checkout main
git pull
# Make fix
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: description"
git push origin main
# Railway deploys automatically
```

## üìù Git Workflow Best Practices

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production (auto-deploys to Railway)
- `develop` - Development branch (optional)
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

### Commit Messages

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add WebSocket security improvements"
git commit -m "Fix database connection pool timeout"
git commit -m "Update CORS configuration for Railway"

# Bad commit messages
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "changes"
```
